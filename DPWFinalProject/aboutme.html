                <section class="article-body">
                    <p>My career path was not a direct one. For more than a decade, I built a career in
                        healthcare as a speech-language pathologist collaborating
                        with patients, families and other healthcare professionals, to assess speech and swallow
                        function in individuals with neurological disorders.
                        I worked hard to help
                        individuals improve their ability to eat, speak and function in their day-to-day lives again.
                        While I did not know it at the
                        time,
                        this was the perfect place to hone the <strong>professional skills</strong> that I rely on and
                        value today such
                        as the <strong>discipline</strong> required to follow through and advocate for patients and
                        families, the
                        <strong>effective communication skills</strong> required to report to physicians what I was
                        observing and what I
                        was recommending, and the <strong>problem solving</strong> skills required to help patients
                        manage their disorder
                        and meet their goals.
                    </p>
                    <p></p>
                    <p>It was when I was
                        participating at the first
                        <strong>Tech Moms in Color Cohort (TMiC)</strong> in the Fall of 2023, when I
                        started to see a new path for myself -- a way to use my skill set of <strong>reporting,
                            collaborating</strong> and <strong>communicating</strong> efficiently <strong> to identify
                            and solve problems</strong>.
                        During my
                        time with TMiC, I received an introduction to the field of <strong>Quality Assurance</strong>
                        and realized that
                        my
                        skills
                        were inline with the skills required for this line of work.
