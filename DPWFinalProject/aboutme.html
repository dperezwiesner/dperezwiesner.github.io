                <h2>DARLENE PÉREZ WIESNER...</h2>
                <br>
                <p>My career path was not a direct one. For more than a decade, I built a career in healthcare
                    collaborating
                    with patients, families and other healthcare professionals, to assess neurological disorders, help
                    people eat, speak and function in their day-to-day-lives again. While I did not know it at the time,
                    this was the perfect place to hone the professional skills that I rely on and value today. These
                    include being a good listener, creative problem-solver, excellent with time management, and having
                    strong attention to detail. I needed all these skills with the reports I wrote on a daily basis.</p>
                <p>It was when I was
                    participating at the first
                    Tech Moms in Color Cohort, TMiC, in the Fall of 2023, when I
                    started to see a new path for myself -- a way to use my skills to identify and solve problems.
                    During my
                    time with TMiC, I received an introduction to the field of Quality Assurance and realized that
                    my
                    skills
                    were inline with the skills required for this line of work. </p>
                <br>
                <p>Through the amazing community of women-tech professionals associated with TechMoms.org, I found
                    my
                    path
                    forward and am making a major career change. I am currently making plans to take additional
                    course
                    work
                    and acquire certifications
                    to prepare for work in an entry level position as a Quality Assurance Engineer. </p>
