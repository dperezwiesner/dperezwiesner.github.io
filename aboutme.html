            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My career path was not a direct one. For more than a decade, I built a career in healthcare collaborating
                with patients, families and other healthcare professionals, to assess neurological disorders, help

                to prepare for work in an entry level position with Quality Assurance. I plan to continue my study in
                preparation for work as a software engineer.</p>
